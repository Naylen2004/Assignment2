  <h4>Please read my mission statement below. </h3>

<p> There have been a lot of changes in the last months. 
    I'm a quick learner and making the most of my life. I’m learning a whole lot 
    in my Web Programming class and am looking forward to learn even more. 
    I’ve played with more technologies, 
     architectures and systems than ever before. Since a couple of months I’ve had 
     the urge to rewrite my mission statement to meet my new reality. Here it is.</p>
  <p><strong>I am team player </strong> I've with my many teams and I'm good with interacting with my co-workers</p>
  <p><strong>I am and always will be a student </strong> I will keep the beginners mind by playing
     and experimenting without the fear of failure. There will always be things I 
     have to learn and I will make mistakes, which develop me.</p>
  <p><strong>I am an optimist and a realist </strong>I always apply this mission statement
     in good faith and to achieve great results together with my team. In doing so,
      I am willing to learn and to teach.  However, I acknowledge reality and respect mission statements of other people. </p>
